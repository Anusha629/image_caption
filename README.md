# image_caption_generator
a graphical interface for selecting an image file and generating captions for the selected image using
the pre-trained Vision Encoder-Decoder model with a ViT backbone.
--># import libraries
• os:for interacting with the operating system.
•	PIL.Image: The Python Imaging Library module for opening and manipulating images.
•	torch: The PyTorch library for tensor computations.
•	transformers: The Hugging Face Transformers library for natural language processing tasks.
•	tkinter: The standard Python interface for creating GUI applications.

-->#	Load pre-trained models and tokenizer:
•	The VisionEncoderDecoderModel is loaded from the "nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning" pre-trained model. This model combines a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone with a GPT-2 language model head for image captioning.
•	The ViTFeatureExtractor is loaded from the same pre-trained model. It provides the necessary image preprocessing and encoding functionalities for the Vision Encoder-Decoder model.
•	The AutoTokenizer is loaded from the same pre-trained model. It is used to tokenize the generated captions.

--># 	Set device:
•	The code checks if a CUDA-compatible GPU is available. If so, the model will be loaded on the GPU; otherwise, it will be loaded on the CPU.

-->#	Set generation parameters:
•	max_length defines the maximum length of the generated captions.
•	num_beams defines the number of beams to use during caption generation. Beams are used in beam search to explore multiple possible captions.

-->#	Define the predict_step function:
•	This function takes a list of image paths and an optional parameter num_captions to specify the number of captions to generate for each image.
•	It opens and converts the images to RGB format using PIL.
•	The ViTFeatureExtractor is used to preprocess and encode the images into pixel values.
•	The pixel values are then passed to the VisionEncoderDecoderModel for caption generation.
•	The generated caption IDs are decoded using the tokenizer, and the special tokens are removed.
•	The function returns a list of generated captions.

-->#	Define the get_image_caption function:
•	This function takes an image path and calls the predict_step function with the image path to generate captions.
